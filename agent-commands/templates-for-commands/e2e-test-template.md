### 1.2 Goals

- **Validate critical user journeys** end-to-end across all system components
- **Ensure system integration** between frontend, backend, database, and external services
- **Verify business workflows** function correctly in production-like environments
- **Detect integration issues** early in the development cycle
- **Provide confidence** for releases through automated regression testing
- **Document expected behavior** through executable specifications

### 1.3 Audience

- QA Engineers implementing test automation
- Developers understanding test coverage
- Product Managers verifying business requirements
- DevOps Engineers setting up test infrastructure
- Project Managers tracking quality metrics

### 1.4 System Overview

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Provide brief system overview based on architecture
-->

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Approach

**E2E Test Philosophy**:

E2E tests in this project focus on:

- ✅ **Critical user paths** that deliver core business value
- ✅ **System integration points** between major components
- ✅ **Business workflows** spanning multiple features
- ✅ **User-visible behavior** from UI to database
- ❌ **NOT unit-level logic** (covered by unit tests)
- ❌ **NOT component-level details** (covered by integration tests)

**Test Pyramid Position**:

```
       /\        ← E2E Tests (Few, slow, broad coverage)
      /  \       ← Integration Tests (More, faster, component integration)
     /____\      ← Unit Tests (Many, fast, focused)
```

E2E tests are the **smallest layer** of the test pyramid but provide the **highest confidence** that the system works as a whole.

### 2.2 Testing Types

**Primary E2E Testing**:

- **UI-driven tests**: Simulate real user interactions through the browser/app
- **API-driven tests**: Validate backend workflows and integrations
- **Database validation**: Verify data persistence and integrity
- **Cross-system flows**: Test integrations with external services

**Supplementary Testing** (within E2E scope):

- **Visual regression**: Detect unintended UI changes
- **Accessibility**: Validate WCAG compliance in user flows
- **Performance**: Measure response times under realistic load
- **Security**: Test authentication, authorization, and data protection

### 2.3 Test Levels

| Level | Focus | Examples | Execution Frequency |
| ------- | ------- |----------|---------------------|
| **Smoke Tests** | Critical happy paths | Login, view dashboard, logout | Every commit |
| **Regression Tests** | Core features | All critical user journeys | Daily/nightly |
| **Full Suite** | Comprehensive coverage | All scenarios including edge cases | Weekly/pre-release |
| **Release Tests** | Production readiness | Critical paths + data migration | Before each release |

### 2.4 Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria** (when to run E2E tests):

- [ ] Unit tests pass ≥ 90%
- [ ] Integration tests pass ≥ 85%
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Test environment is available and stable
- [ ] Test data is prepared

**Exit Criteria** (when E2E test run is complete):

- [ ] Smoke tests pass 100%
- [ ] Regression tests pass ≥ 95%
- [ ] No P0 (critical) failures
- [ ] All test reports generated
- [ ] Failed tests triaged and documented

## 6. Test Data Management

### 6.1 Test Data Strategy

**Approach**: [Choose: Fixed fixtures, Factory pattern, Database seeding, API-generated]

**Principles**:

- **Isolation**: Each test uses independent data to avoid conflicts
- **Repeatability**: Tests produce same results with same data
- **Cleanup**: Data is cleaned up after test completion
- **Privacy**: No real user data; synthetic data only
- **Realism**: Test data resembles production data patterns

### 6.2 Test Data Types

| Data Type | Source | Storage | Lifecycle |
| ----------- | -------- |---------|-----------|
| **User Accounts** | Factory/Seeding | Database | Created before test, deleted after |
| **Product Data** | Fixed fixtures | JSON files | Loaded once, reused |
| **Transaction Data** | Generated per test | Database | Created during test, deleted after |
| **Configuration** | Environment variables | Config files | Persistent |
| **External API Responses** | Mock data | JSON fixtures | Static, version controlled |

### 6.3 Test Data Generation

**User Data Factory** (example):

```typescript
// Example: TypeScript test data factory
class UserFactory {
  static create(overrides?: Partial<User>): User {
    return {
      email: `test-${Date.now()}@example.com`,
      firstName: 'Test',
      lastName: 'User',
      password: 'SecurePass123!',
      role: 'user',
      ...overrides
    }
  }
  
  static createAdmin(): User {
    return this.create({ role: 'admin' })
  }
}
```

### 6.4 Test Data Cleanup

**Cleanup Strategy**:

- **Automatic**: Use test framework hooks (afterEach, afterAll)
- **Database transactions**: Rollback after each test (if possible)
- **Soft delete**: Mark test data with `is_test_data=true` flag
- **Scheduled cleanup**: Daily job to remove old test data

**Example Cleanup**:

```typescript
afterEach(async () => {
  // Delete test users created in this test
  await database.users.deleteMany({
    email: { contains: 'test-' }
  })
})
```

### 6.5 Sensitive Data Handling

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how to handle sensitive data in tests
-->

**Rules**:

- ❌ **NEVER** use real user data, emails, or phone numbers
- ❌ **NEVER** use real payment card numbers (use test cards)
- ❌ **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to git
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use fake data generators (Faker.js, etc.)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use environment variables for credentials
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use test payment gateways (Stripe test mode, etc.)

**Test Payment Cards**:

| Card Type | Number | CVV | Expiry | Result |
| ----------- | -------- |-----|--------|--------|
| Visa | 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Any 3 digits | Future date | Success |
| Mastercard | 5555 5555 5555 4444 | Any 3 digits | Future date | Success |
| Declined | 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Any 3 digits | Future date | Card declined |

## 7. Test Environments

### 7.1 Environment Configurations

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define test environments based on architecture
-->

| Environment | Purpose | URL | Data | External Services |
| ------------- | --------- |-----|------|-------------------|
| **Local** | Development testing | localhost:3000 | Seed data | Mocked |
| **CI** | Automated test runs | ephemeral | Generated per run | Mocked |
| **Staging** | Pre-production testing | staging.example.com | Anonymized prod-like | Mix of real/mocked |
| **QA** | Manual QA testing | qa.example.com | Curated test data | Real (test accounts) |

### 7.2 Environment Setup

**Local Development Environment**:

```bash
# Example: Docker Compose setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed test data
npm run db:seed:test

# Start application
npm run start:test
```

**CI Environment**:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions
- name: Setup test environment
  run: |
    docker-compose up -d postgres redis
    npm run db:migrate
    npm run db:seed:test
```

### 7.3 Service Mocking Strategy

**When to Mock**:

- External payment gateways (use test mode or mock)
- Email services (use test inbox or mock SMTP)
- SMS services (use mock provider)
- Third-party APIs with rate limits
- Services with costs per request

**When to Use Real Services**:

- Internal microservices (test real integration)
- Database (use real database, not in-memory)
- Authentication service (test real auth flow)

**Mocking Tools**:

- **API Mocking**: WireMock, MSW (Mock Service Worker), Nock
- **Email**: Mailhog, Mailtrap, Ethereal
- **Database**: Test database instance (not mocked)

### 7.4 Infrastructure Requirements

**Compute**:

- CPU: [e.g., 4 cores minimum]
- Memory: [e.g., 8GB RAM minimum]
- Storage: [e.g., 50GB SSD]

**Network**:

- Stable internet connection for external API calls
- VPN access if testing internal services
- Firewall rules for test environment access

**Dependencies**:

- Database: [PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, etc.]
- Message Queue: [RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. if needed]
- Cache: [Redis, Memcached, etc.]
- External Services: [Payment gateway test environment, etc.]

## 9. Test Architecture

### 9.1 Design Pattern

**Pattern**: [e.g., Page Object Model (POM)]

**Structure**:

```
tests/
├── e2e/
│   ├── pages/              # Page Object Models
│   │   ├── LoginPage.ts
│   │   ├── DashboardPage.ts
│   │   └── CheckoutPage.ts
│   ├── fixtures/           # Test data
│   │   ├── users.json
│   │   └── products.json
│   ├── helpers/            # Utility functions
│   │   ├── auth.ts
│   │   ├── database.ts
│   │   └── api.ts

│   │   └── smoke/
│   │       └── critical-paths.spec.ts
│   └── config/             # Test configuration
│       └── setup.ts
```

### 9.2 Page Object Example

```typescript
// Example: Page Object Model
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}
  
  // Locators
  private emailInput = () => this.page.locator('#email')
  private passwordInput = () => this.page.locator('#password')
  private loginButton = () => this.page.locator('button[type="submit"]')
  private errorMessage = () => this.page.locator('.error-message')
  
  // Actions
  async navigate() {
    await this.page.goto('/login')
  }
  
  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.emailInput().fill(email)
    await this.passwordInput().fill(password)
    await this.loginButton().click()
  }
  
  // Assertions
  async expectLoginSuccess() {
    await expect(this.page).toHaveURL('/dashboard')
  }
  
  async expectLoginError(message: string) {
    await expect(this.errorMessage()).toHaveText(message)
  }
}
```

### 9.3 Test Structure

**AAA Pattern** (Arrange-Act-Assert):

```typescript
test('User can login with valid credentials', async ({ page }) => {
  // ARRANGE - Setup test data and preconditions
  const user = await UserFactory.create()
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page)
  await loginPage.navigate()
  
  // ACT - Perform the action being tested
  await loginPage.login(user.email, user.password)
  
  // ASSERT - Verify expected outcomes
  await loginPage.expectLoginSuccess()
  await expect(page.locator('.welcome-message')).toContainText(user.firstName)
  
  // Verify in database
  const dbUser = await database.users.findByEmail(user.email)
  expect(dbUser.lastLoginAt).toBeDefined()
})
```

### 9.4 Test Organization

**Naming Conventions**:

- Test files: `*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts`
- Page objects: `*Page.ts`
- Helpers: `*.helper.ts`
- Fixtures: `*.fixture.ts` or `*.json`

**Test Tags**:

```typescript
test.describe('Authentication', { tag: '@smoke' }, () => {
  test('Login with valid credentials', { tag: '@critical' }, async () => {
    // test implementation
  })
  
  test('Login with invalid credentials', { tag: '@negative' }, async () => {
    // test implementation
  })
})
```

### 10.4 Parallel Execution

**Strategy**: [e.g., Shard tests across multiple workers]

**Configuration**:

- **Workers**: [e.g., 4 parallel workers]
- **Sharding**: [e.g., Split by test file]
- **Retry**: [e.g., 2 retries on failure]

**Example**:

```bash
# Run tests in parallel with 4 workers
npx playwright test --workers=4

# Run specific shard (for CI parallelization)
npx playwright test --shard=1/4
npx playwright test --shard=2/4
```

### 10.5 Execution Triggers

| Trigger | Suite | Condition |
| --------- | ------- |-----------|
| **Git Push** | Smoke | Every push to main/develop |
| **Pull Request** | Smoke + affected scenarios | PR opened/updated |
| **Scheduled** | Regression | Daily at 2 AM |
| **Manual** | Full | On-demand via CI dashboard |
| **Release** | Release suite | Tag created |

## 11. Reporting & Metrics

### 11.1 Test Reports

**Report Types**:

- **HTML Report**: Human-readable test results with screenshots/videos
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable for processing
- **Allure Report**: Rich interactive report with history
- **JUnit XML**: For CI/CD integration

**Report Storage**:

- CI artifacts: [e.g., 30 days retention]
- ReportPortal: [e.g., Persistent storage with history]

### 11.2 Dashboards

**Metrics Dashboard** should display:

- Test pass rate (overall and per suite)
- Test execution duration trends
- Flaky test detection
- Test coverage (scenarios vs requirements)
- Failure analysis (top failing tests)

**Example Metrics**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ E2E Test Metrics - Last 7 Days          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Pass Rate:          96.5%               │
│ Avg Duration:       45 minutes          │
│ Total Tests:        287                 │
│ Flaky Tests:        4 (1.4%)            │
│ Failed Tests:       10                  │
│ Skipped Tests:      3                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 11.3 Failure Notifications

**Notification Channels**:

- Slack: [e.g., #test-failures channel]
- Email: [e.g., QA team email]
- GitHub: PR comments for PR-triggered tests

**Notification Rules**:

- **Smoke failures**: Immediate notification
- **Regression failures**: Summary after full run
- **Flaky tests**: Weekly digest

### 11.4 Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
| -------- | ------------ |--------|
| **Pass Rate** | (Passed / Total) × 100 | ≥ 95% |
| **Execution Time** | Time to run full suite | ≤ 4 hours |
| **Flaky Rate** | Intermittent failures | ≤ 2% |
| **Coverage** | Scenarios covered / Total requirements | ≥ 90% |
| **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)** | Avg time to fix failing test | ≤ 24 hours |

## 12. Maintenance & Improvement

### 12.1 Flaky Test Management

**Definition**: A flaky test passes and fails intermittently without code changes.

**Identification**:

- Track test history in ReportPortal/Allure
- Flag tests with inconsistent results
- Monitor retry counts

**Resolution**:

1. **Investigate root cause** (timing, race conditions, external dependencies)
2. **Fix or quarantine** (mark with `@flaky` tag, run separately)
3. **Document issue** in test code comments
4. **Track in backlog** for prioritized fixing

**Example**:

```typescript
test('Flaky test example', async ({ page }) => {
  // Known flaky: Sometimes element loads slowly
  // TODO: Investigate and fix (TICKET-123)
  await page.waitForSelector('.dynamic-content', { timeout: 10000 })
})
```

### 12.2 Test Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Owner |
| ------ | ----------- |-------|
| Review flaky tests | Weekly | QA Lead |
| Update test data | Monthly | QA Team |
| Review test coverage | Monthly | QA + Dev |
| Refactor test code | Quarterly | QA Team |
| Update framework/tools | Quarterly | QA Lead |
| Archive obsolete tests | Quarterly | QA Lead |

### 12.3 Test Refactoring

**When to Refactor**:

- Tests become slow (> 5 min per test)
- Tests are hard to understand
- High duplication across tests
- Test maintenance takes > 30% of QA time

**Refactoring Techniques**:

- Extract common actions to helpers
- Use fixtures for repeated setup
- Implement Page Object Model
- Reduce test data generation overhead
- Parallelize independent tests

### 12.4 Continuous Improvement

**Review Process**:

1. **Weekly**: Review failed tests and flakiness
2. **Monthly**: Analyze metrics and trends
3. **Quarterly**: Evaluate tooling and architecture

**Improvement Areas**:

- Test execution speed optimization
- Test coverage gap analysis
- Framework upgrade evaluation
- New tool adoption (visual testing, performance, etc.)
